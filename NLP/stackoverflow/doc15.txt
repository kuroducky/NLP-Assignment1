How come certain random strings produce colors when entered as background colors in HTML? For example:

<body bgcolor="chucknorris"> test </body>

...produces a document with a red background across all browsers and platforms.

Interestingly, while chucknorri produces a red background as well, chucknorr produces a yellow background.

Whatâ€™s going on here?
