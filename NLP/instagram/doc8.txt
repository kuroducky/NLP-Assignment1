What do you wear when you're the first person to walk on the moon in 50 years? A brand-new spacesuit of course!🌑👩‍🚀
That is what Nasa is testing out at the underwater facilities at the Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas. The space agency has been developing the equipment ahead of plans for its next big mission to the lunar surface scheduled for 2024. The mission, called Artemis 3, will mark the first time people have landed on the Moon in nearly 50 years. The tests involve practising picking up rocks and planting an American flag, with the underwater conditions designed to help astronauts prepare for working in low-gravity conditions. It is the first new spacesuit Nasa has developed in 40 years and is quite different from the ones astronauts have been using until now. Daren Welsh, who leads spacewalk tests, said: "We have experience with space station, but we need to determine how we're going to train the crew for surface operations during these specific missions."
