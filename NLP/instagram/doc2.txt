It's a great story and so needed"

Fleetwood Mac's drummer Mick Fleetwood has surprised the star of a TikTok video featuring the band's 1977 hit song Dreams. Nathan Apodaca from Idaho filmed himself skateboarding to the track while drinking cranberry juice. The drummer joined the app and recreated the clip in his garden. The videos led to Dreams getting its biggest ever week on streaming services - with more than 8 million streams in the US alone in the past week. Mick told Natha he's "so happy to be part of it". #Dreams #FleetwoodMac #TikTok #Music #BBCNews
