Hundreds of fans have gathered to pay tribute to one of Iran's most celebrated singers Mohammad Reza Shajarian, who has died at the age of 80. Dubbed "Maestro" by generations of fans, Shajarian was a classical Persian musician and composer with a career spanning over 50 years. Early in his career he sang in support of Iran's Islamic revolution in 1979, but authorities later banned him from holding concerts and releasing music due to his support for anti-government protests in 2009. Four years ago, the musician revealed he'd been living with cancer for 15 years, but it is unclear if this was the cause of his death. His son, Homayoun, shared the news in a statement on Instagram, saying he "flew to meet his beloved". Videos on social media show fans gathering outside the hospital where he died, singing his songs. Iranian president Hassan Rouhani tweeted that "the grateful nation" would "always keep the name, memory and work of this popular artist alive in their memory".
