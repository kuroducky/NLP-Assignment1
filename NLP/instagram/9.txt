Hawaii photographer and surfer Doug Falter lost his surfboard in February 2018. Five years later, the board reappeared more than 5,000 miles away in the Philippines. As it turns out, the board had been discovered six months after its disappearance by a fisherman who then sold it to aspiring surfer Giovanne Branzuela, a primary school teacher in the southern Philippines. Falter now plans to travel to the Philippines after the coronavirus pandemic is over to teach Branzuela how to surf and retrieve his surfboard.
