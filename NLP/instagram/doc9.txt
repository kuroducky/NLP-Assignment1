"When I saw how big it actually was, it was crazy"

Did you know TikTok's most-watched clip was influenced by rapper from Blackpool, UK? Millie Bracewell, better known as Millie B, wrote a diss track four years ago when she was 16 "as a laugh". But in August, Filipino-American influencer Bella Poarch mimed to the song - including the lyrics "it's M to the B" - after finding the clip on the app. The video has since been watched almost half a billion times, liked 38 million times and had 1.2 million comments. Millie, who is now 20, has been telling us she's had "a few major record labels get in touch" and hopes she'll be able to "make real music that relates to me" off the back of the success. #TikTok #Viral #MtotheB #Music #BBCNews
