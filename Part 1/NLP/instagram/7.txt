Shockingly large chunks of ash fell from the sky as a result of the Glass Fire in Santa Rosa, California, resident Morgan Balaei said Monday. The Glass Fire has exploded to more than 36,000 acres in less than 48 hours, forcing thousands of people to evacuate. There have been more than 8,100 wildfires in California this year and firefighters continue to fight at least 25 major blazes, Cal Fire said on Sunday.
