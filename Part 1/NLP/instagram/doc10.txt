This sarcophagus has been opened for the first time in 2,500 years. It was excavated by the Egyptian archaeological mission working at the Saqqara necropolis, 30km south of the capital Cairo. The project unearthed a sprawling burial ground with more than 59 human coffins covered in intricate designs and hieroglyphics. Saqqara, the cemetery site of the ancient Egyptian capital of Memphis, is a UNESCO World Heritage site. (Getty Images) #Egypt #AncientEgypt #Saqqara #bbcnews
